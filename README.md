# Android Calculator App

This is a simple yet powerful **calculator app** built using **Kotlin** and the **Jetpack Compose** framework with **Material Design**. The app is designed to handle basic mathematical expressions with an intuitive user interface and real-time feedback on user input.

## Features
- **Core functionality**:
  - The app calculates mathematical expressions, including parentheses, with support for operator precedence.
  - Error handling for invalid input and mathematical exceptions (e.g., division by zero).
  - Real-time **preview** of results as you type.
  - Developed to predict user actions and errors for a smooth experience.

- **Technologies used**:
  - Written in **Kotlin**.
  - User interface developed using **Jetpack Compose** and **Material Design** principles.
  
- **Custom calculation logic**:
  - All computation logic is custom-built from scratch and encapsulated within a dedicated class, providing flexibility and control over operations.
  - The application follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture, making it modular and easy to extend.

- **Extensibility**:
  - The app is designed to be easily extendable. New features and operations can be integrated into the core functionality with minimal effort.

## Contribution
Contributions are always welcome! The current app functionality is solid, but there is room for improvement, especially in the **UI layout and design**. If you're interested in contributing, feel free to submit pull requests or open issues.

Areas where contributions would be especially helpful:
- Improving the **user interface** and **layout** with better design principles.
- Adding new mathematical operations and features.

Looking forward to your contributions! Together, we can improve and grow this project.
